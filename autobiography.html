        <h1>AUTOBIOGRAPHY</h1>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">I am Russell Allan G. Mondala Jr., 22 years old, born on February 22, 1999 in Dagupan City but I am currently living in Raja;, Balungao, Pangasinan. I graduated in both Elementary and High School in Remnant International School. After graduating high school, I started studying at Saint Louise University as a Civil Engineer but unfortunately it's not the course that I wanted to take, later on I shifted in Urdaneta City University as an Information Technology student and started studying different programming langauages. Beside form studying, I am also into online games and weight lifting in the gym which I do in my free time.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">A few years from now, after graduating college, I see myself as successful programmer while also having multiple businesses and giving my family a better life.</p>
